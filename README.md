# Collatz Conjecture Solver
This Python application demonstrates a solution to the Collatz Conjecture, an unsolved mathematical problem that explores sequences generated from positive integers.

# Introduction
The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem or the Hailstone sequence, involves taking any positive integer and applying the following rules:
* If the number is even, divide it by 2.
* If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
The conjecture posits that no matter the starting number, the sequence will always eventually reach 1.

# Features
* Computes the Collatz sequence for any positive integer.
* Visualizes the sequence progression.
* Analyzes sequence characteristics such as length and peak values.
